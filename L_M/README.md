# Library Management System

This project is a simple **Library Management System** developed using C++ and MySQL for database operations. It allows administrators to add books and students to the library database, and users can borrow books if they are available.

## Features

- **Administrator Role**:
  - Add new books to the library.
  - Add new students to the database.

- **User Role**:
  - Check available books.
  - Borrow books if available.
  
## Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need to have the following installed:

- C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC, MinGW)
- MySQL Server and Client
- MySQL C API Library
- Windows OS

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/LibraryManagementSystem.git
   cd LibraryManagementSystem
   ```

2. **Configure MySQL Database**:

   - Start your MySQL server and create a new database named `mydb`:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE mydb;
     USE mydb;
     ```

   - Create the `lib` and `student` tables:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE lib (
       Name VARCHAR(255),
       Quantity INT
     );

     CREATE TABLE student (
       Id VARCHAR(50)
     );
     ```

3. **Set up the MySQL connection**:

   In the code, update the following constants with your MySQL credentials:
   ```cpp
   const char* HOST = "localhost";
   const char* USER = "root"; // Replace with your MySQL username
   const char* PW = "";       // Replace with your MySQL password
   const char* DB = "mydb";   // Your database name
   ```

4. **Compile and Run**:

   Compile the program using a C++ compiler with MySQL C API:
   ```bash
   g++ library_management.cpp -o library_management -lmysqlclient
   ```

   Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./library_management
   ```

## Usage

- **Administrator**:
  - Choose the "Administration" option.
  - Add books and students by following the prompts.

- **User**:
  - Choose the "User" option.
  - Enter your student ID and the name of the book you'd like to borrow.

## Libraries Used

- [MySQL C API](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/en/)
- Standard C++ Libraries

## Known Issues

- The system currently assumes that a student exists before they can borrow a book. If a student is not registered, they cannot borrow a book.
- The MySQL connection credentials are hardcoded into the source code. Future enhancements could include a more secure way of handling database credentials.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement more robust error handling.
- Add features for book returns and fines.
- Implement a GUI interface for ease of use.
